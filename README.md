# Uptime

This app is designed to detect how long a Mac has been running, and prompt the end-user to reboot after a predetermined amount of time. 

For more detailed information about how the tool works please see the wiki.

Credit to Bart Reardon as I'm utilizing his #SwiftDialog tool to create the window that prompts the user to update.
